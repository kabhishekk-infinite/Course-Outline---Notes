DBMS : Database Management System\

Database : Defined as the storage of inter related data that has been organized in such a fashion that the process of retrieval of data is efficient and effective

Management System : Set of programs to access the data

DBMS : is an environment that is both convenient and efficient

Purpose of DBMS : Earlier data was stored directly on top of the file system

DBMS architecture : 3 layered
1. Physical : actual data stored in the Hard disk
2. Logical/Conceptual : Customer (custid , Name , Address, country, phone,
3. Application :application programs can hide sensitive data from the user and provide only the rest


Types of DBMS :
  1. HDBMs - Hierarchical Database management system 
  2. NDBMS - Network Dbms
  3. RDBMS - Relation dbms (Relational Algebra/set theory) 
  4. Object RDBMS 
      - multimedia
      - hypertext based databases


RDBMs : Data is perceived to be in rows and columnar structures knows as Relations/Tables
        Columns are the attributes that describe the data 
        Rows contain the actual data
RDBMS Fundamental Concepts
A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a type of database management system (DBMS) that stores data in a structured format, using rows and columns. It is the most common type of DBMS used today. Here are the fundamental concepts:

Tables: Data is organized in tables, which consist of rows and columns. Each table represents a different entity (e.g., customers, orders).

Rows (Records): Each row in a table represents a single record, which is an instance of the entity. For example, a row in a customer table represents one customer.

Columns (Fields): Columns represent the attributes of the entity. Each column has a specific data type (e.g., integer, string, date).

Primary Key: A unique identifier for each record in a table. The primary key ensures that each record can be uniquely identified. For example, a customer ID in the customer table.

Foreign Key: A field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. Foreign keys are used to create relationships between tables.

Relationships: Tables can be related to one another through primary and foreign keys. There are different types of relationships:

One-to-One: Each record in one table is related to a single record in another table.
One-to-Many: Each record in one table can be related to multiple records in another table.
Many-to-Many: Records in one table can be related to multiple records in another table and vice versa.

SQL (Structured Query Language): The standard language used to communicate with RDBMS. SQL is used to perform various operations such as querying data, inserting, updating, and deleting records.

Normalization: The process of organizing data to minimize redundancy. It involves dividing large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships between them.

ACID Properties: Ensure that database transactions are processed reliably. They include:

Atomicity: Ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed; otherwise, the transaction is aborted.
Consistency: Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.
Isolation: Ensures that transactions are processed independently and changes are not visible until the transaction is committed.
Durability: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains so, even in the event of a system failure.


SQL: Standard language for managing relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
NoSQL: Database systems that handle unstructured data and scale horizontally (e.g., MongoDB, Redis).
MySQL: A popular open-source RDBMS used in web applications, a type of SQL database.
